# TODO
 - resolve TODOs left into the code
 - tests:
   - tests with removal of trxd-shared (and fault tolerance)
   - tg webhook tests in pipeline
   - add tests with a lot of hash named challs (hard cap for networks on nginx?) (try change IPAM to /30 to preserve addrs)
   - integration tests (for generic behaviour)
   - tests for distributed functioning
 - utility:
   - better names for binary flags
   - DOCUMENTATION
  - backender frontend ideas: (i'm not a pro frontender, so these may not be good ideas)
    - make the `[overview, solves]` the same between the team and user page
    - put the category breakdown in the user page when in User Mode
    - change the url of users from /account to /users
    - default chall creation, make the points dynamic by default, make the type Normal by default and the types in order (Normal, Container, Compose)

## Frontend
 - [x] Make countdown timer more efficient
 - [x] Lazy load monaco editor
 - [x] Virtualize country select
 - [/] Extra:
   - [ ] Add custom button themes for first/second/third bloods? (Analysis done)

## Ideas / Features
 - rename "hash domain" (not an hash anymore, only rand bytes)
 - make retries on registration with email
 - put descriptions on configs
 - divide configs by section (secrets, instances, something like this...)
 - dropdown menu for containers (for container instances)
 - editable homepage & theme
 - instances page (admin only)
 - deletable instances (from admin)
 - submission page (admin only)
 - deletable submissions (from admin)
 - link to join team
 - extract data for ctftime
 - invisible teams
 - N instance limit per team
 - scoreboard freeze (idea: use a table or a view to take a snapshot of the scoreboard, update it every time someone solves if not in freeze time (or just prefetch and compute if not exists))
 - telegram bot for first bloods (and webhook generalization)
 - login via CTFTime
 - default starting points for challenges as global config
 - kube support
 - swarm support
 - ctf stats page
 - flag submit that checks for all challenges and mark solved the one of the correct flag (credits to: midnightsun)
 - writeups for challs into the platform (visible after ctf ends)
 - signed flags (AES ECB or hmac with team id (4 byte) and chall id (4 byte))
 - tls instances: https://github.com/inconshreveable/slt
 - likes and dislikes for challs (only for who actually solved)
 - kick user from team
 - endpoint to store image files (like badges and pfp)
 - flag format validator
 - ingress only challenges (verify if useful)
 - chall time schedule release
 - login via /verify with a valid token
 - chall sequence (unlock a challenge by solving another chall)
