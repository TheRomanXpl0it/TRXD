- change name of challs, network and so on, with $PROJECT_NAME prefix
- batch updates for configs / challs or whatever
- single user mode, send user id instead of team id (ex scoreboard)
- no submission on hidden chall
- cleanup hook for failed instances
- optimize badge queries
- instance data validation (maybe)

QOS:
	- flush cache flag
	- verify no comunication between instances on standard default bridge network
	- change csrf token name
	- error generator for tests
	- split main.go flag function
	- resolve TODOs left into the code

ALPHA:
	- dockerize 🙏
	- config to start and end ctf
	- integration tests (for generic behaviour)
	- tests for distributed functioning
	- role configuraion endpoint
	- dropdown menu categories
	- dropdown menu container
	- DOCUMENTATION

EXTRA:
	- editable homepage & theme
	- deletable instances (from admin)
	- deletable submissions (from admin)
	- link to join team
	- endpoint + cli cmd to parse a category/challenge file (maybe yaml) with all infos
	- extract data for ctftime
	- scoreboard freeze (idea: use a table or a view to take a snapshot of the scoreboard, update it every time someone solves if not in freeze time (or just prefetch and compute if not exists))
	- telegram bot for first bloods
	- when finished endpoints, review needed data and revome `RETURNING *;` and similar when not needed
	- hash verifier flag or script

BONUS IDEAS:
	- maybe set default starting points for challenges as global config
	- ctf stats page
	- flag submit that checks for all challenges and mark solved the one of the correct flag (credits to: midnightsun)
	- writeups for challs into the platform (visible after ctf ends)
	- signed flags (aes ecb with team id (4 byte) and chall id (4 byte))
	- tls instances: https://github.com/inconshreveable/slt
	- likes and dislikes for challs (only for who actually solved)
	- kick user from team
	- timeout on endpoints
	- optional mail server
	- endpoint to store image files (like badges and pfp)
